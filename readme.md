* Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.

* Clean install of Fallout 4, with all DLCs **except **HD DLC. Non-negotiable.

* A Nexusmods account. Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.

* 50 Gb of space. 22 Gb for the downloads folder, and 28 Gb for the actual install.

Once Fallout 4 is installed, **make sure you run it once**. (Get to the Fallout 4 splash screen, and exit).

* Go to [BiRaitBec’s Modding Guide.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description)

* Manually download the WorkBase file.

* Manually download the Main Repack files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).

* Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.

* Inside of the Workbase folder, create 2 folders called 'OriginalBa2' and 'PatchedBa2'.

* You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.

* Navigate to your Fallout4/Data folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:

1. 'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'

2. 'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'

3. 'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'

4. 'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'

5. 'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'

6. 'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'

7. 'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'

8. 'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'

9. 'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'

10. 'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'

11. 'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'

12. 'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'

13. 'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'2

14. 'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'

15. 'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'

* Paste these files into your WorkBase/OriginalBa2 folder.

* Extract all three Main Repack files.

* Move and combine the "Textures" folders from these extracted archives into the "PatchedFiles" folder.

* Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase.

* When it is done, cut and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder.

* Navigate back to the WorkBase folder.

* After all of these steps are complete, you may delete the WorkBase folder.

*Note that you ***_CANNOT _***use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization. You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.*

# ![image alt text](images/image_7.png)

* Download the latest version of Wabbajack.

* Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).

* Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.

* Download the newest Boston Cream Pie file from the "Browse Modlists" menu

* Launch Wabbajack.exe

* Select "Install a Modlist"

* Choose the BostonCreamPie.wabbajack file you just downloaded.

* In "Installation Location" choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Boston Cream Pie). This location **CANNOT** be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.

* The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.

* Click the "Play" arrow.

* Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.

* When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

![image alt text](images/image_8.png)

* Navigate back to your Boston Cream Pie installation folder.

* Open "Game Folder Files"

* Copy everything in this folder.

* Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).

**_Optional Mods:_**

* If you would like the game to be more difficult, enable Wasteland Ballistics, and Fallsouls.

* If you have an Ultrawide monitor, enable the TruBy9 UltraWide Fallout 4 patch to fix issues with UI scaling

![image alt text](images/image_9.png)

* Navigate to your Boston Cream Pie directory.

* Open the "Tools" folder, then the “[Fallout 4 Configuration Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/102)” folder.

* Right-click "Fallout4ConfigTool.exe" and Run as Administrator.

* When FO4Config launches, navigate to the Settings tab.

* Make sure your filepaths align with where you have Boston Cream Pie installed, as shown below. Your folder names may be different.

![image alt text](images/image_10.png)

Next, navigate to the Tweaks tab. Make your screen matches the one shown below. You can change sensitivity options if you like. Make sure your game resolution here matches your monitor’s resolution.

![image alt text](images/image_11.png)

Next, navigate to the Performance tab. Again, make sure the options on your screen match what’s in the image below.

Note: If you ran FO4Config through MO2’s executables, you will need to exit out and run the exe as Administrator to enable the "High Priority" option.

![image alt text](images/image_12.png)

Navigate to the Camera tab next. Keep making the images match what you see.

Some prefer their Field of View at 80, 85, or 95. It’s up to you.

![image alt text](images/image_13.png)

Onward to the Textures tab. You know what to do.

![image alt text](images/image_14.png)

This is entirely optional. If you want to see different colors instead of the standard green in your pipboy, click the "Disable FX" option and select a color of your choosing.

![image alt text](images/image_15.png)

Gameplay tab! The difficulty numbers correspond with the in-game difficulties. 3 is Hard. If you want Normal, drop it to 2. The higher the number, the higher the difficulty.

Note: I know "All NPC’s Killable" is tempting, but you **will** break a lot of quests and scripts if you play this way.

![image alt text](images/image_16.png)

Click "**Save**" in the bottom left.

**That’s almost it! **Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the Boston Cream Pie folder. From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the "F4SE" option.

If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties, go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to "Only update this game when I launch it." Make sure Steam is launched and logged in before launching Fo4 with F4SE or else Steam will launch the native way and force an update should there be one available. Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again should you do as I have just instructed.

![image alt text](images/image_17.png)

After the intro movie, click ‘Don’t Show Update Messages Again’ on the Wasteland Imports menu. 

After creating your character, wait for all messages to stop appearing in the top left corner, and open the Mod Configuration Menu and apply these settings:

FallSouls (Only if activated as optional addon)

-MessageBoxMenu -- OFF

-TerminalMenu -- OFF

SPECIALMenu -- OFF

Workshop Framework

* Message Options

    * Suppress Messages During Combat - ON

Workshop Plus

* Options

    * Autosave Timer 5

Then, save and restart your game if you have FallSouls activated. Load back in, and proceed through the door to continue.

Now, we still have a little bit of work left to do, but we’re almost done. Now we can launch the game. Once you finish character customization, you’ll have three options when you try to leave.

* **This is a dream**: You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You’re just a random Pre-war Sanctuary citizen.

* **This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this**: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate or Nora. Everything else is normal.

* **This is a memory, stay here a while**: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.

After you open the Vault door, two menus will open. On the first menu, select ‘Main Menu [default]. Select ‘Only for NPC’s’ on the second menu.

When the LAER menu appears, select ‘No (Only placed LAERs are acquirable)’

After you leave the Vault, you will want to open the SKK Combat Stalkers Holotape in your inventory, and enable the first two options, then scroll down and click the ‘Submit’ option to start the scripts for that mod.
